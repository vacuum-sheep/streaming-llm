      "response": "Alright, so I need to convert the rectangular coordinate (0, 3) to polar coordinates. Hmm, okay. I remember that polar coordinates are represented as (r, \u03b8), where r is the radius or the distance from the origin to the point, and \u03b8 is the angle made with the positive x-axis. \n\nFirst, let me recall the formulas for converting rectangular coordinates (x, y) to polar coordinates (r, \u03b8). I think r is calculated using the Pythagorean theorem, so r = sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2). And \u03b8 is found using the arctangent function, \u03b8 = arctan(y/x). But wait, I also remember that sometimes arctan(y/x) isn't enough because it doesn't account for the correct quadrant. So, I might need to adjust \u03b8 based on the signs of x and y.\n\nOkay, let's apply this to the point (0, 3). So, x is 0 and y is 3. Let me compute r first. Plugging into the formula, r = sqrt(0\u00b2 + 3\u00b2) = sqrt(0 + 9) = sqrt(9) = 3. That seems straightforward. So, r is 3.\n\nNow, onto \u03b8. Since x is 0 and y is 3, let's think about where this point lies on the coordinate plane. When x is 0, the point is on the y-axis. Since y is positive, it's on the positive y-axis. So, the angle \u03b8 should be 90 degrees, or \u03c0/2 radians, right? Because from the positive x-axis, if you go up 90 degrees, you reach the positive y-axis.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Sometimes when x is 0, the angle is either \u03c0/2 or 3\u03c0/2, depending on whether y is positive or negative. In this case, y is positive, so it's \u03c0/2. So, \u03b8 is \u03c0/2.\n\nLet me double-check using the arctangent formula. \u03b8 = arctan(y/x). But here, x is 0, so arctan(3/0). Hmm, 3 divided by 0 is undefined. I remember that arctan approaches \u03c0/2 as the input approaches infinity, but when x is 0, it's a special case. So, in this situation, since x is 0 and y is positive, \u03b8 is indeed \u03c0/2. If x were negative and y positive, \u03b8 would be \u03c0/2 plus something, but since x is 0, it's exactly \u03c0/2.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the polar coordinates are (3, \u03c0/2). Let me just visualize this to make sure. Starting at the origin, moving 3 units up along the y-axis, which is exactly at 90 degrees from the positive x-axis. Yep, that makes sense.\n\nI don't think I made any mistakes here. The point is on the y-axis, so the radius is just the y-coordinate, which is 3, and the angle is \u03c0/2. So, I'm confident that the polar coordinates are (3, \u03c0/2).\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe polar coordinates are \\boxed{(3, \\frac{\\pi}{2})}.\n</think>\n\nTo convert the rectangular coordinate \\((0, 3)\\) to polar coordinates, we use the formulas for \\(r\\) and \\(\\theta\\).\n\nFirst, we calculate \\(r\\) using the Pythagorean theorem:\n\\[\nr = \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} = \\sqrt{0^2 + 3^2} = \\sqrt{9} = 3\n\\]\n\nNext, we determine \\(\\theta\\). Since the point \\((0, 3)\\) lies on the positive \\(y\\)-axis, the angle \\(\\theta\\) is \\(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\) radians.\n\nThus, the polar coordinates are:\n\\[\n\\boxed{(3, \\frac{\\pi}{2})}\n\\]"

      "response": "Alright, so I have this function f(x) = (3x - 2)/(x - 2), and I need to find the sum of f(-2), f(-1), and f(0). Hmm, okay. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should probably figure out what each of these f(-2), f(-1), and f(0) is individually, and then add them up. That seems straightforward. Let me start with f(-2).\n\nSo, f(-2) would be plugging x = -2 into the function. Let me write that out:\n\nf(-2) = (3*(-2) - 2)/(-2 - 2)\n\nLet me compute the numerator and denominator separately to avoid mistakes.\n\nNumerator: 3*(-2) is -6, and then minus 2 is -8.\n\nDenominator: -2 - 2 is -4.\n\nSo, f(-2) = (-8)/(-4). Hmm, dividing two negatives gives a positive, so that's 2. Okay, so f(-2) is 2.\n\nAlright, moving on to f(-1). Let me plug x = -1 into the function.\n\nf(-1) = (3*(-1) - 2)/(-1 - 2)\n\nAgain, compute numerator and denominator separately.\n\nNumerator: 3*(-1) is -3, minus 2 is -5.\n\nDenominator: -1 - 2 is -3.\n\nSo, f(-1) = (-5)/(-3). Again, two negatives make a positive, so that's 5/3. Hmm, okay, so f(-1) is 5/3.\n\nNow, onto f(0). Plugging x = 0 into the function.\n\nf(0) = (3*0 - 2)/(0 - 2)\n\nCompute numerator and denominator.\n\nNumerator: 3*0 is 0, minus 2 is -2.\n\nDenominator: 0 - 2 is -2.\n\nSo, f(0) = (-2)/(-2). That simplifies to 1. So, f(0) is 1.\n\nNow, I need to add these three results together: f(-2) + f(-1) + f(0) = 2 + 5/3 + 1.\n\nLet me compute that. First, 2 + 1 is 3, and then adding 5/3 to that.\n\nSo, 3 is the same as 9/3, right? Because 3 divided by 1 is 9/3. So, 9/3 + 5/3 is 14/3.\n\nWait, hold on, is that right? Let me double-check.\n\n2 is 2/1, 5/3 is already a fraction, and 1 is 1/1. So, to add them together, I need a common denominator. The denominators are 1, 3, and 1. The least common denominator is 3.\n\nSo, converting each term to have a denominator of 3:\n\n2 = 6/3\n\n5/3 stays the same.\n\n1 = 3/3\n\nSo, adding them together: 6/3 + 5/3 + 3/3 = (6 + 5 + 3)/3 = 14/3.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the sum is 14/3.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I didn't make any calculation errors earlier.\n\nStarting with f(-2):\n\n(3*(-2) - 2)/(-2 - 2) = (-6 - 2)/(-4) = (-8)/(-4) = 2. That's correct.\n\nf(-1):\n\n(3*(-1) - 2)/(-1 - 2) = (-3 - 2)/(-3) = (-5)/(-3) = 5/3. Correct.\n\nf(0):\n\n(0 - 2)/(0 - 2) = (-2)/(-2) = 1. Correct.\n\nAdding them: 2 + 5/3 + 1. 2 + 1 is 3, plus 5/3 is 3 + 1 2/3, which is 4 2/3, which is 14/3. Yep, that's right.\n\nSo, the final answer is 14/3.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of \\( f(-2) + f(-1) + f(0) \\) is \\boxed{\\dfrac{14}{3}}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the value of \\( f(-2) + f(-1) + f(0) \\) for the function \\( f(x) = \\frac{3x - 2}{x - 2} \\), we evaluate each term individually and then sum them up.\n\nFirst, we calculate \\( f(-2) \\):\n\\[\nf(-2) = \\frac{3(-2) - 2}{-2 - 2} = \\frac{-6 - 2}{-4} = \\frac{-8}{-4} = 2\n\\]\n\nNext, we calculate \\( f(-1) \\):\n\\[\nf(-1) = \\frac{3(-1) - 2}{-1 - 2} = \\frac{-3 - 2}{-3} = \\frac{-5}{-3} = \\frac{5}{3}\n\\]\n\nThen, we calculate \\( f(0) \\):\n\\[\nf(0) = \\frac{3(0) - 2}{0 - 2} = \\frac{0 - 2}{-2} = \\frac{-2}{-2} = 1\n\\]\n\nAdding these results together:\n\\[\nf(-2) + f(-1) + f(0) = 2 + \\frac{5}{3} + 1\n\\]\n\nConverting each term to have a common denominator of 3:\n\\[\n2 = \\frac{6}{3}, \\quad 1 = \\frac{3}{3}\n\\]\n\nThus, we have:\n\\[\n\\frac{6}{3} + \\frac{5}{3} + \\frac{3}{3} = \\frac{6 + 5 + 3}{3} = \\frac{14}{3}\n\\]\n\nThe value of \\( f(-2) + f(-1) + f(0) \\) is \\boxed{\\dfrac{14}{3}}."

      "question": "How many positive whole-number divisors does 196 have?",
      "correct_answer": "9",
      "predicted_answer": "9",
      "is_correct": true,
      "response": "Alright, so I have this problem: \"How many positive whole-number divisors does 196 have?\" Hmm, okay. I remember that to find the number of divisors of a number, I need to look at its prime factorization first. Once I have that, there's some formula involving the exponents of the prime factors. Let me try to recall how that works.\n\nFirst, let me figure out the prime factors of 196. I know that 196 is an even number, so it's divisible by 2. Let me divide it by 2: 196 \u00f7 2 = 98. Okay, 98 is still even, so I can divide by 2 again: 98 \u00f7 2 = 49. Now, 49 is a number I recognize. It's 7 squared, right? So, 49 = 7 \u00d7 7. Therefore, putting it all together, the prime factors of 196 are 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 7 \u00d7 7. \n\nWait, let me write that in exponent form to make it clearer. So, 196 can be expressed as 2\u00b2 \u00d7 7\u00b2. Yeah, that looks right because 2 squared is 4 and 7 squared is 49, and 4 \u00d7 49 is indeed 196.\n\nNow, I remember that the formula for finding the number of positive divisors is to take the exponents of the prime factors, add one to each of them, and then multiply those together. So, if a number N can be written as p\u2081^a \u00d7 p\u2082^b \u00d7 ... \u00d7 p\u2099^k, where p\u2081, p\u2082, ..., p\u2099 are prime factors, then the number of positive divisors is (a+1)(b+1)...(k+1). \n\nApplying that to 196, which is 2\u00b2 \u00d7 7\u00b2, the exponents are 2 and 2. So, adding one to each gives me 3 and 3. Then, multiplying those together: 3 \u00d7 3 = 9. So, does that mean 196 has 9 positive divisors? Hmm, let me double-check that.\n\nTo make sure I didn't make a mistake, maybe I should list all the divisors of 196 and count them. Let's see. Starting from 1, since 1 is a divisor of every number. Then, 2, because it's even. 4, since 2 \u00d7 2 is 4. 7, because 7 \u00d7 28 is 196. 14, because 7 \u00d7 2 is 14. 28, because 14 \u00d7 2 is 28. 49, because 7 \u00d7 7 is 49. 98, because 49 \u00d7 2 is 98. And finally, 196 itself.\n\nLet me list them out: 1, 2, 4, 7, 14, 28, 49, 98, 196. Counting these, that's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. Yep, that's 9 divisors. So, that matches what I got earlier using the formula. That gives me more confidence that the answer is indeed 9.\n\nWait, just to make sure I didn't miss any divisors when listing them. Let me think. The number is 196, which is 14 squared, right? 14 \u00d7 14 is 196. So, the divisors should come in pairs that multiply to 196. Let me pair them up:\n\n1 and 196,\n2 and 98,\n4 and 49,\n7 and 28,\n14 and 14.\n\nWait, hold on, 14 is paired with itself. So, that's why when I listed them out, I had 1, 2, 4, 7, 14, 28, 49, 98, 196. So, that's 9 numbers, which includes the square root (14) only once. So, that makes sense because when a number is a perfect square, one of the divisors is repeated in the middle.\n\nSo, that also confirms that the number of divisors is 9. Therefore, I think I can confidently say that 196 has 9 positive whole-number divisors.\n\nJust to recap, the steps I took were:\n\n1. Find the prime factorization of 196, which is 2\u00b2 \u00d7 7\u00b2.\n2. Apply the formula for the number of divisors: (2+1)(2+1) = 9.\n3. Verified by listing all the divisors and counting them, which also gave me 9.\n4. Cross-checked by pairing the divisors, which showed that 14 is the square root and only counted once.\n\nSo, all methods point to the same answer. I don't think I made any mistakes here. It's always good to verify using multiple methods to ensure accuracy, especially when dealing with mathematical concepts that can sometimes be tricky.\n\nAnother thing I could consider is whether I might have missed any divisors when listing them. Let me go through the list again:\n\n1: Yes, 1 is a divisor.\n2: 196 \u00f7 2 = 98, which is an integer, so 2 is a divisor.\n4: 196 \u00f7 4 = 49, which is an integer, so 4 is a divisor.\n7: 196 \u00f7 7 = 28, which is an integer, so 7 is a divisor.\n14: 196 \u00f7 14 = 14, which is an integer, so 14 is a divisor.\n28: 196 \u00f7 28 = 7, which is an integer, so 28 is a divisor.\n49: 196 \u00f7 49 = 4, which is an integer, so 49 is a divisor.\n98: 196 \u00f7 98 = 2, which is an integer, so 98 is a divisor.\n196: 196 \u00f7 196 = 1, which is an integer, so 196 is a divisor.\n\nYep, that's all of them. I don't think I missed any. So, that's another confirmation.\n\nI guess another way to think about it is that since 196 is 14 squared, and 14 is 2 \u00d7 7, so 14 squared is (2 \u00d7 7) squared, which is 2\u00b2 \u00d7 7\u00b2. So, that's consistent with the prime factorization I did earlier.\n\nSo, in summary, the number of positive whole-number divisors of 196 is 9. I think that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of positive whole-number divisors of 196 is \\boxed{9}.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many positive whole-number divisors 196 has, we start by finding its prime factorization. \n\n196 is an even number, so we divide by 2:\n\\[ 196 \\div 2 = 98 \\]\n98 is still even, so we divide by 2 again:\n\\[ 98 \\div 2 = 49 \\]\n49 is a known square number, specifically \\(7^2\\). Therefore, the prime factorization of 196 is:\n\\[ 196 = 2^2 \\times 7^2 \\]\n\nUsing the formula for the number of divisors, which involves taking the exponents of the prime factors, adding one to each, and then multiplying those results together, we get:\n\\[ (2 + 1)(2 + 1) = 3 \\times 3 = 9 \\]\n\nTo verify, we list all the divisors of 196: 1, 2, 4, 7, 14, 28, 49, 98, 196. Counting these, we find there are 9 divisors.\n\nThus, the number of positive whole-number divisors of 196 is \\(\\boxed{9}\\)."
