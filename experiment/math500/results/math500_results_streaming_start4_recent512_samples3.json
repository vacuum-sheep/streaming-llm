      "response": ", so I need to convert the rectangular coordinate (0, 3) to polar coordinates. Hmm, I remember that polar coordinates are represented as (r, \u03b8), where r is the distance from the origin and \u03b8 is the angle from the positive x-axis. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formulas, so let me think.\n\nFirst, I think r is calculated using the distance formula. Since the point is (0, 3), that means it's on the y-axis, right? So, the distance from the origin should just be the y-coordinate, which is 3. That seems straightforward.\n\nNow, for the angle \u03b8. I recall that \u03b8 is calculated using the arctangent of y over x. But wait, in this case, the x-coordinate is 0. Hmm, if x is 0, does that mean the angle is 90 degrees? Because if you're on the y-axis, you're either straight up or down. Since the y-coordinate is positive, it should be 90 degrees or \u03c0/2 radians. But I should make sure if it's 90 degrees or 270 degrees. Since the point is (0, 3), it's above the origin on the positive y-axis, so \u03b8 should be \u03c0/2 radians.\n\nLet me double-check the formulas to be sure. The conversion formulas are:\n\nr = \u221a(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2)\n\n\u03b8 = arctan(y / x)\n\nBut when x is 0, arctan(y / x) becomes arctan(3 / 0), which is undefined. That's why I need to consider the quadrant. Since x is 0 and y is positive, the point is on the positive y-axis, so \u03b8 is \u03c0/2.\n\nSo, putting it all together, r is 3 and \u03b8 is \u03c0/2. Therefore, the polar coordinates should be (3, \u03c0/2).\n</think>\n\nThe rectangular coordinate (0, 3) converts to polar coordinates as follows:\n\n- **r** is calculated using the distance formula: \\( r = \\sqrt{0^2 + 3^2} = 3 \\).\n- **\u03b8** is the angle from the positive x-axis. Since the point is on the positive y-axis, \\( \\theta = \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\).\n\nThus, the polar coordinates are \\(\\boxed{(3, \\frac{\\pi}{2})}\\)."

      "question": "How many positive whole-number divisors does 196 have?",
      "correct_answer": "9",
      "predicted_answer": "9",
      "is_correct": true,
      "response": ", so I need to figure out how many positive whole-number divisors 196 has. Hmm, okay, let's start by recalling what a divisor is. A divisor of a number is another number that can divide it without leaving a remainder. So, for example, 1 is a divisor of every number, and the number itself is also a divisor. But I guess I need to find all the numbers that can divide 196 exactly.\n\nFirst, I think it would help to factorize 196 into its prime factors. Prime factorization is breaking down a number into the product of prime numbers. Let me try that. I know that 196 is an even number, so it's divisible by 2. Dividing 196 by 2 gives me 98. Okay, so 2 is one prime factor.\n\nNow, 98 is also even, so I can divide by 2 again. 98 divided by 2 is 49. So now I have 2 times 2, which is 2 squared. Next, 49 is a number I recognize as a perfect square. It's 7 times 7, right? So, 49 divided by 7 is 7. Therefore, the prime factors of 196 are 2 squared times 7 squared.\n\nSo, 196 equals 2 squared times 7 squared. Now, to find the number of positive divisors, I remember that if a number is expressed as a product of primes raised to exponents, like \\( p^a \\times q^b \\times r^c \\), then the number of divisors is \\( (a+1)(b+1)(c+1) \\). So, applying that here, the exponents are 2 and 2 for primes 2 and 7 respectively.\n\nCalculating that, it would be (2+1)(2+1) = 3 times 3, which is 9. So, 196 has 9 positive whole-number divisors.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. If I list out all the divisors, they should be 1, 2, 4, 7, 14, 28, 49, 98, and 196. That's 9 numbers. Yep, that matches my earlier calculation. So, I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\n196 has 9 positive whole-number divisors.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Prime Factorization of 196:**\n   - 196 is even, so divide by 2: \\( 196 \u00f7 2 = 98 \\).\n   - 98 is also even, divide by 2: \\( 98 \u00f7 2 = 49 \\).\n   - 49 is a perfect square, so divide by 7: \\( 49 \u00f7 7 = 7 \\).\n   - 7 is a prime number.\n   \n   Therefore, the prime factors are \\( 2^2 \\times 7^2 \\).\n\n2. **Calculating the Number of Divisors:**\n   - If a number is expressed as \\( p^a \\times q^b \\times r^c \\), the number of divisors is \\( (a+1)(b+1)(c+1) \\).\n   - For \\( 2^2 \\times 7^2 \\), the exponents are 2 and 2.\n   - Number of divisors = \\( (2+1)(2+1) = 3 \\times 3 = 9 \\).\n\n3. **Listing the Divisors (Verification):**\n   - The divisors of 196 are: 1, 2, 4, 7, 14, 28, 49, 98, 196.\n   - Counting these gives 9 divisors.\n\n**Answer:** 196 has 9 positive whole-number divisors."
