      "question": "How many positive whole-number divisors does 196 have?",
      "correct_answer": "9",
      "predicted_answer": "9",
      "is_correct": true,
      "response": ", so I need to figure out how many positive whole-number divisors 196 has. Hmm, okay, let's start by recalling what a divisor is. A divisor of a number is another number that can divide it without leaving a remainder. So, for example, 1 is a divisor of every number, and the number itself is also a divisor. But I guess I need to find all the numbers that can divide 196 exactly.\n\nFirst, I think it would help to factorize 196 into its prime factors. Prime factorization is breaking down a number into the product of prime numbers. Let me try that. I know that 196 is an even number, so it's divisible by 2. Dividing 196 by 2 gives me 98. Okay, so 2 is one prime factor.\n\nNow, 98 is also even, so I can divide by 2 again. 98 divided by 2 is 49. So now I have 2 times 2, which is 2 squared. Next, 49 is a number I recognize as a perfect square. It's 7 times 7, right? So, 49 divided by 7 is 7. Therefore, the prime factors of 196 are 2 squared times 7 squared. So, 196 equals 2\u00b2 times 7\u00b2.\n\nNow, to find the number of positive divisors, I remember there's a formula for that. If a number is expressed as a product of primes raised to exponents, like p^a times q^b, then the number of divisors is (a+1) times (b+1). So, in this case, the exponents are 2 and 2. Adding one to each gives me 3 and 3. Multiplying those together, 3 times 3 is 9. So, 196 has 9 positive whole-number divisors.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. If I list out all the divisors, they should be 1, 2, 4, 7, 14, 28, 49, 98, and 196. That's nine numbers. Yep, that matches the calculation. So, I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of positive whole-number divisors of 196, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Prime Factorization**: First, express 196 as a product of its prime factors.\n   - 196 is even, so divide by 2: \\(196 \u00f7 2 = 98\\).\n   - 98 is also even, so divide by 2: \\(98 \u00f7 2 = 49\\).\n   - 49 is a perfect square: \\(49 = 7 \u00d7 7\\).\n   - Therefore, the prime factorization of 196 is \\(2^2 \u00d7 7^2\\).\n\n2. **Calculate the Number of Divisors**: Use the formula for the number of divisors. If a number \\(N\\) has a prime factorization of \\(p^a \u00d7 q^b\\), the number of divisors is \\((a+1)(b+1)\\).\n   - For 196, \\(a = 2\\) and \\(b = 2\\).\n   - Number of divisors = \\((2+1)(2+1) = 3 \u00d7 3 = 9\\).\n\n**Answer**: 196 has \\(\\boxed{9}\\) positive whole-number divisors."
